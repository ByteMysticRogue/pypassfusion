Introduction

I developed this password generating program using Python to provide users with a simple yet efficient way to:

1. Generate a brand new password for any platform of their choosing.

2. Add already existing passwords.

3. Save all generated or customized passwords, along with the title of the platform they're being used on, as a text file at the user's specified destination.

4. You can then access your passwords by searching for this (.txt) file on your Windows/Linux or macOs system.
